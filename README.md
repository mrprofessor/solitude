# Solitude

Solitude aims to be a note taking web application storing notes in git repositories.

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run
```

Note: To deploy easily to github I am using `docs/` as my primary folder.

```bash
npm run build
# After building it copies the build folder to docs
```

### TODOS:

1. ~~Add an appropriate editor~~
2. Support both markdown and org
3. Add rich text support
4. Integrate with Github
